<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p style="padding: 10% 10% 10% 10%; font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 20px;">This project mainly aims at analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews on various e-commerce websites. This will help the user to get an idea about the product that they are buying. This can also be utilized by the e-commerce giants to get feedback on the product that they are selling. This allows them to gain an understanding of attitudes, opinions & emotions expressed within an online mention.
We will use a bag of words model and Na√Øve Bayes model to perform sentiment analysis by classifying the reviews for effective product recommendation. This will give the user an insight about how the other buyers feel about the product.
